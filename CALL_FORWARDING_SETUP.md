   - Auth Token
   - Phone Number (format: `+1xxxxxxxxxx`)

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd llm_convo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# AI Configuration (FREE)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here

# Business Search
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here

# Phone Service
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1xxxxxxxxxx

# Optional: Default location for "near me" searches
DEFAULT_SEARCH_LOCATION=Mumbai
```

### Step 3: Test the System

```bash
# Start the call forwarding service
python examples/call_forwarding_bot.py --preload_whisper --start_ngrok

# For existing phone bot with call forwarding:
python examples/groq_phone_bot.py --bot_type call_forwarding --start_ngrok
```

### Step 4: Configure Twilio Webhook

1. Copy the ngrok URL from the terminal (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
2. Go to your Twilio Console ‚Üí Phone Numbers
3. Click on your phone number
4. Set the webhook URL to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/incoming-voice`
5. Save configuration

### Step 5: Test with Phone Call

Call your Twilio phone number and try:

- "I need a dentist in Mumbai"
- "Find me a restaurant in Delhi"
- "I want a mechanic near me"

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Business Search

**Caller**: "I need a dentist in Ahmedabad"

**System**: Searches and connects to nearest available hospital

### Restaurant Recommendations

```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python examples/call_forwarding_bot.py \
    --port 8091 \                    # Port to run on
    --start_ngrok \                  # Create public tunnel
