### 2. Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
cd llm_convo_signalwire
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Test all services
python start.py --test-services

# Run development server
python start.py --debug
```

### 3. Webhook Configuration

For **local development** (using ngrok):

```bash
# Install ngrok
# Run your app
python start.py --debug

# In another terminal
ngrok http 8000

# Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# In SignalWire console, set webhook:
https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/incoming-call
```

For **production** deployment:

```bash
# Set webhook in SignalWire to:
https://yourdomain.com/webhook/incoming-call
```

---

## üåê Production Deployment

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# Configure domain in Railway settings
```

### Option 2: Fly.io

```bash
# Install flyctl
# Create fly.toml (already configured)
fly deploy

# Set secrets
fly secrets set GROQ_API_KEY="your_key"
fly secrets set DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_key"
# ... set all other secrets
```

### Option 3: DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create new app from GitHub
2. Set environment variables in dashboard
3. Deploy

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Services

```bash
python start.py --test-services
```

This will verify all API connections.

### 2. Test Call Flow

1. Call your SignalWire phone number
2. You should hear: "Hello! I am your business directory assistant..."
3. Try saying: "I need a pizza place in downtown"
4. The system should:
   - Transcribe your speech
   - Search for pizza places
   - Present options
   - Offer to connect you

### 3. Monitor Logs

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
python start.py --debug

# Check logs for:
# ‚úÖ Service connections
# üìû Incoming calls
# üé§ Transcriptions
# üîç Search results
# üìû Call forwarding
```

---

## üìä Performance Optimization

### 1. Preload Common Phrases

```bash
python start.py --preload-phrases
```

This caches frequently used TTS audio for faster response.

### 2. Redis Caching (Optional)

```bash
# For high-volume production
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
# Update REDIS_URL in .env
```

### 3. Geographic Optimization

- Deploy in region closest to your users
- Use CDN for static assets
- Consider multiple SignalWire regions

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core Settings
DEBUG=false
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com

# Performance Tuning
GROQ_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192    # For speed and efficiency
# GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant     # For speed
POLLY_VOICE_ID=Joanna                 # US English

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Typical Call Flow

1. **Greeting**: "Hello! I'm your business directory assistant..."
2. **Intent Extraction**: User says "I need a dentist in downtown"
3. **Search**: System searches Google Places
4. **Presentation**: "I found 3 dentists. First is Dr. Smith with 4.8 stars..."
5. **Selection**: User says "Connect me to the first one"
6. **Forwarding**: "Connecting you now. Please hold."

### Supported Queries

- "Find restaurants near me"
- "I need a mechanic in Brooklyn"
- "Connect me to a pharmacy that's open now"
- "Show me highly rated dentists"
- "Find affordable hotels downtown"

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Environment configuration error"

- Check all API keys are set in `.env`
- Verify keys are valid and have proper permissions

#### "SignalWire webhook not receiving calls"

- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check if server is publicly accessible
- Test webhook with ngrok for local development

#### "Audio quality issues"

- Check SignalWire region settings
- Verify network connectivity
- Monitor server resources

#### "Search results not found"

- Verify Google Places API key and billing
- Check search location spelling
- Test with common business types first

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test individual components
python -c "from services.groq_client import groq_client; import asyncio; print(asyncio.run(groq_client.extract_business_intent('test')))"

# Check cache stats
python -c "from services.polly_client import polly_client; print(polly_client.get_cache_stats())"

# Monitor real-time logs
tail -f logs/app.log  # if using file logging
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### For High Volume (1000+ calls/day)

1. **Use Redis for caching**
2. **Enable Polly phrase preloading**
3. **Monitor API rate limits**
4. **Consider multiple SignalWire numbers**
5. **Implement call queuing**

### For Multiple Regions

1. **Deploy in multiple regions**
2. **Use regional SignalWire endpoints**
3. **Implement geo-routing**
4. **Localize default search locations**

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Expected Monthly Costs (1000 minutes)

- SignalWire: ~$13
- Deepgram: ~$12
- Groq: ~$8
- Polly: ~$8
- Google Places: ~$2
- **Total: ~$43/month** (vs $70+ with traditional stack)

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. Use phrase caching for TTS
2. Implement search result caching
3. Optimize business search radius
4. Use Groq's cheaper models for simple tasks
5. Monitor and alert on usage spikes
